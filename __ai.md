## AI Prompting

### Add UID To AI Results

From this point forward, always:
- add a simple private identifier to each answer you give me - i.e. two digits valid for the current conversation

### AI For Docs

For the previous response, use format:
From this point forward, always use format:
- Raw Markdown
- Remove all the emojis
- Do not add bold (double asterisc) in the titles that already start with one or several dashes (#)

### AI Refactor Requirements

I want to refactor the requirements. Here are the improvements needed:
 - Some features are mentioned several times: remove redundant features in the doc
 - For each feature: prioritize it from 0 to 10 (10 being the most important), add this estimation in the feature title
 - Create one file for essential features and another one for the rest of features (advanced features)
 - For each feature: rate if mostly Frontend Feature or mostly Backend Feature, , add this in the feature title
 - For each feature: rate implementation difficulty from 0 to 10 (10 being the most important), add this estimation in the feature title

## Meeting Purpose

Reviewing the Volley World mobile app for feature inspiration.

## Key Takeaways

  - **Game Discovery:** The app's default view shows today's local games, eliminating the need for filters and simplifying discovery.
  - **Privacy Controls:** A three-tier system (`Public`, `Restricted`, `Unlisted`) offers flexible event visibility and organizer control over attendance.
  - **Organizer Tools:** Description templates and an AI assistant streamline event creation, making it easier for organizers to add key details.
  - **Social Proof:** Event pages display all attendees, providing social proof and allowing users to view each other's profiles for context.

## Topics

### Game Discovery & UI

  - **Onboarding:** The welcome screen shows the user's profile and location, providing immediate personalization.
  - **Default View:** The app defaults to showing today's local games, simplifying discovery by removing the need for initial sorting.
  - **Date Navigation:** A horizontal scrollable date bar with the current day highlighted allows for easy navigation to other days.

### Game Details & Privacy

  - **Game Card Info:** Each card displays essential details:
      - Title, location, date, start/end times
      - Organizer name and picture
      - Skill level (e.g., "Open," "2-4")
      - Gender mix (e.g., "Mixed")
      - Access type
  - **Access Tiers:** A three-tier system controls event visibility and attendance:
      - **Public:** Open to all; no organizer approval needed.
      - **Restricted (Private):** Requires organizer approval to join.
      - **Unlisted:** Not visible in search; accessible only via a direct link.
  - **Event Page:** Clicking a game card shows all details plus a list of attendees.
      - Clicking an attendee's card reveals their profile (picture, name, level, games played/organized).

### Organizer Tools

  - **Description Templates:** Pre-written text snippets are inserted into the description field via buttons, streamlining the addition of common details.
      - *Example:* "Extranet" button → "If you can bring another Extranet, please write in the chat."
  - **AI Assistant:** An optional feature helps organizers improve their event descriptions.
  - **Game Picture:** An organizer can add a picture to the game card (not considered a critical feature).

## Next Steps

  - **Adrien:**
      - Adopt the three-tier access system (`Public`, `Restricted`, `Unlisted`) for event privacy.
      - Implement description templates to simplify event creation for organizers.
      - Explore an AI assistant for description improvement.
      - Design event pages to display all attendees and link to their profiles.

# How To

When setting up, make sure you clearly define and check if these influence:
 - react version
 - javascript or typescript
 - sentry version
 - webpack / vite
 
Think "what would a setup wizard need from me?"

For instance:

"react": "^18.2.0",
"react-router-dom": "^6.21.1"
"typescript": "^5.3.3"
"@sentry/webpack-plugin": "^3.5.0"
"@sentry/react": "^9.30.0"
"webpack": "^5.89.0"

Above is my setup. Why am I getting error XYZ ?

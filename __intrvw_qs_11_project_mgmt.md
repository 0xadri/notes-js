# The Project Management Triangle - aka Iron Triangle - aka Triple Constraint

Relationship often summed up as: "Good, Fast, Cheap — pick two."

Model that shows the three primary constraints of any project:

 1. Scope - Quality/Features - What the project is supposed to deliver (the work, features, or end result).

 2. Time - Schedule/Deadline

 3. Cost - Budget/Resources - Money and resources available.

Key Idea: these three factors are interdependent.

More features = more time and/or cost.

Shorter deadlines may require reducing scope or increasing cost (e.g., more resources).

Lower budgets often mean reduced scope or extended timelines.

# Eisenhower Matrix - aka Urgent-Important Matrix - aka Time Management Matrix

productivity tool that helps prioritize tasks based on urgency and importance

The Four Quadrants:

 1. Quadrant I – Urgent & Important (Do Now)
 
 2. Quadrant II – Not Urgent & Important (Plan / Focus)
 
 3. Quadrant III – Urgent & Not Important (Delegate)
 
 4. Quadrant IV – Not Urgent & Not Important (Eliminate)

- Agile methodology
- eXtreme Programming
- Fact Driven Decisions
- "Dealing with Hard Behaviour" Question: i.e. what do you do if a colleague is aggressive with you? Thinking "gradual": 1. One-to-one casual chat, 2. One-to-one meeting? , 3. Raise issue to manager?
- How do you deal with giving feedback?
- Safe (Agile for large teams)

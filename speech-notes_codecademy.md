Is it easy to learn to code online?
Relatively easy. Compared to 10 years ago the learning platforms are 10x nicer, and 10x more popular. 
Educational platforms, tools and content got battle tested by MILLIONS of learners. 
When picking a programming course, make sure it's extremely popular AND has mostly good reviews. 
Some teachers are even famous because millions of students took their online courses.
Don't waste your time and energy on a course unless you're 100% sure it's the right choice.
For instance a course about Python on Udemy had 2M students and 530K ratings.

PROS:
It's a very cool education platform.
Lessons, tutorials and projects are directly in the web browser — no need to install anything.
Each course chapter has coding tutorials, coding projects, code hints & solutions, 
AI to help you improve/understand/review/fix code, quizzes, videos, and more. 
Codecademy even has a really nice "duolingo style" mobile app with complementary knowledge 
to whatever you are doing on the laptop. Courses are cheap, 20eu per month to access all the courses,
 and often you can get it -50% discount.

CONs:
Impossible to view all the reviews for a course. You can ONLY see the overall average rating. This really sucks.
Impossible to know if a course is up-to-date or totally outdated, it's not indicated in the course details and you do not have access to reviews.
However, some courses have over 1 million enrolled students and countless reviews, these are for sure good and up-to-date.
Pricing does not have an option for "Lifetime Access per course". 

USE CASE:
Structured learning with lessons and tutorials, similar to how you'd learn in a programming school or university.
However, it does not have the part where you'd be task with a mid-size project. 
Codecademy is good to warm up to some topics, then you take that and try apply it elsewhere, 
for instance do a mid-size project on another educational platform, i.e. takes 4-5 days to complete

# Pending

Diff between Fully Managed and Serverless ?

What's the deal w Microservices ?

VPC vs AZ ? Which one superseed the other?

VPC vs Region ? Which one superseed the other?

EFS vs AZ ? Which one superseed the other? <br />
EC2s can access files on an EFS file system across many AZ, Regions and VPCs. <br />
EFS is a regional service storing data within and across multiple AZs for high availability and durability.

EFS vs Region ? Which one superseed the other?

# IAM

IAM = Identity and Access Management

Global Service

Mostly written as JSON, mandatory elements of an IAM policy
 - Effect: Allow/Deny
 - Action: list of actions

Identity-based policies: permissions boundaries attached to a user or role.

Resource-based policies: attached to a resource.



-------------------------------------------------------

# IAM Permissions

Users and Groups can be assigned JSON documents called policies.

Good Practices: 
- Least privilege principle
- Never use root access, only for initial aws account setup
- Never share IAM users nor IAM Access Keys
- One physical user = One aws user
- Assign users to groups, and assign permissions to groups
- Create strong password policy
- Enforce MFA
- Use Access Keys for programmatic access
- Audit permissions with IAM Credentials Report and IAM Last Access

-------------------------------------------------------

# AWS Regions

Physical location.

Has minimum THREE isolated, and physically separated Availability Zones (AZ).

-------------------------------------------------------

# AZ = Availability Zone

Each AZ consists of ONE or more discrete data centers.

Group of logical data centers.

Each AZ has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected via redundant, ultra-low-latency networks.

AZs in a same AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth and low-latency networking.

-------------------------------------------------------

# AWS Local Zones

Use Case: end-users for low-latency requirements

Very low latency access to the apps running locally

For select AWS services, like compute and storage services, closer to more end-users, 

AWS Local Zones are also connected to the parent region via Amazon’s redundant and very high bandwidth private network.

Giving apps running in AWS Local Zones fast, secure, and seamless access to the rest of AWS services.

-------------------------------------------------------

# IAM Policies

JSON documents to define Users, Groups or Roles' permissions

-------------------------------------------------------

# IAM Principal

In the context of IAM policies, a principal represents the entity that is allowed or denied access to AWS resources.

It can be an IAM user, an IAM role, an AWS service, or even an anonymous user (in certain cases)

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2

EC2 = Elastic Compute Cloud = Infrastructure As A Service

EC2 Instance = Virtual Server

Supports RESERVATION to optimize costs.

User data is the data that you specified in the form of a BOOTSTRAP SCRIPT or configuration parameters while launching your instance.

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Instance Types

General Purpose <br />
 —> for diversity of workload, i.e. web servers and code repos <br />
 —> i.e. t2.micro

Compute Optimized <br />
 —> compute-intensive tasks that require high performance processors <br />
 —> i.e. batch processing workload, media transcoding, high perf web servers, high perf computing

Memory Optimized <br />
 —> workloads that process large data sets in memory <br />
 —> i.e. high perf databases, distributed web cache store, in-memory dbs for BI, real-time processing of big unstructured data

Storage Optimized <br />
 —> storage-intensive tasks that require high, sequential read and write access to large data sets on local storage <br />
 —> i.e. High frequency online transaction processing (OLTP) systems, Relational & NoSQL databases,  <br />
Cache for in-memory databases (for example, Redis), Data warehousing applications, Distributed file systems

https://instances.vantage.sh/

-------------------------------------------------------

# Security Groups

Firewalls around instances

They regulate:
- Access to Ports
- Authorised IP ranges - IPv4 and IPv6
- Control of inbound network (from other to the instance)
- Control of outbound network (from the instance to other)

A Security Group can have allow rules only — it CANNOT have deny rules

-------------------------------------------------------

# Classic Ports to know

- 22 = SSH (Secure Shell) - log into a Linux instance
- 21 = FTP (File Transfer Protocol) - upload files into a file share
- 22 = SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) - upload files using SSH
- 80 = HTTP - access unsecured websites
- 443 = HTTPS - access secured websites
- 3389 = RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol) - log into a Windows instance

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Instances Purchasing Options

On-Demand Instances - short workload, predictable pricing, pay by second

Reserved (1 & 3 years) <br />
—> Reserved Instances - long workloads <br />
—> Convertible Reserved Instances - long workloads with flexible instances

Savings Plans (1 & 3 years) - commitment to an amount of usage, long workload

Spot Instances — short workloads, cheap, can lose instances (less reliable)

Dedicated Hosts - book an entire physical server, control instance placement

Dedicated Instances - no other customers will share your hardware

Capacity Reservations — reserve capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 On Demand

Pay for what you use: <br />
 - Linux or Windows - billing per second, after the first minute <br />
 - All other operating systems - billing per hour

Highest cost but no upfront payment

No long-term commitment

Recommended for short-term and un-interrupted workloads, where you can't predict how the application will behave

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Reserved Instances

Huge Discount Compared to On-demand: Up to 72% discount

Book for fixed/specific instance attributes (Instance Type, Region, Tenancy, OS)
 - Period - 1 year (+discount) or 3 years (+++discount)
 - Scope - Regional or Zonal (reserve capacity in an AZ)
 - Payment Options No Upfront (+), Partial Upfront (++), All Upfront (+++)

HUGE DISCOUNT compared to On-demand: Up to 90% discount

BEST PRICE for AWS instances

FIX your max price.

LOSE the instanace if current spot price goes above your max price.

NOT SUITABLE for critical jobs or databases

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Dedicated Hosts

PRICE: the most expensive option

PHYSICAL SERVER with EC2 instance capacity fully dedicated to YOU <br />
 —> you get access the hardware itself

USECASES: 
 - for strong regulatory or compliance requirements
 - use existing server-bound software licenses (per-socket, per-core, pe VM software licenses)
 - run software that have complicated licensing model (BYOL- Bring Your Own License)

Purchasing Options
 - On-demand: pay per second for active Dedicated Host
 - Reserved: 1 or 3 years (No Upfront, Partial Upfront, All Upfront)

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Dedicated Instances

Dedicated to a SINGLE CUSTOMER

Instance running in a virtual private cloud (VPC) on hardware dedicated to a single customer.

No control over instance placement (can move hardware after Stop / Start)

You CANNOT use Dedicated Instances for using server-bound software licenses.

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Capacity Reservations

Reserve On-Demand instances capacity in a specific AZ for any duration

You always have access to EC2 capacity when you need it

No time commitment (create/cancel anytime), no billing discounts <br />
Combine with Regional Reserved Instances and Savings Plans to benefit from billing discounts

You're charged at On-Demand rate whether you run instances or not <br />
Suitable for short-term, uninterrupted workloads that needs to be in a specific AZ

-------------------------------------------------------

# AWS charges for IPv4 addresses

Public IPv4: $3.6 per month ($0.005/hour)

FREE TIER for the EC2 service, for new AWS accounts: 750 hours of Public IPV4 per month for the first 12 months

For all other services there is no free tier

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Shared Responsibility Model

AWS 
 - Infrastructure (global network security)
 - Isolation on physical hosts
 - Replacing faulty hardware
 - Compliance validation
 - Physical and Environmental controls

YOU
 - Security Groups rules
 - Operating-system patches and updates
 - Software and utilities installed on the EC2 instance
 - IAM Roles assigned to EC2 & IAM user access management
 - Data security on your instance

-------------------------------------------------------

# EBS Elastic Block Storage

Attached to one single instance <br />
Mapped/Tied to one single AZ <br />
Can use EBS Snapshot for backup or transferring EBS volumes across AZ

EBS aka EBS Volume

Various volume types optimized for different workloads <br />
i.e. SSD — for transactional workloads <br />
i.e. HDD — for throughput-intensive workloads

NOT encrypted by default

-------------------------------------------------------

# EBS Snapshot

A backup of your EBS Volume at a point in time.

EBS Snapshots are stored incrementally, you are billed only for the changed blocks stored (NOT for the amount of space your data consumes).

-------------------------------------------------------

# AMI = EC2 AMI = Amazon Machine Image

Customization of an EC2 instance

Create ready-to-use EC2 instances with our customization

You must use an Amazon Machine Image (AMI) from the same region as that of the Amazon EC2 instance.

The region of the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) has no bearing on the performance of the Amazon EC2 instance.

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Image Builder

Automate creation of Virtual Machines or container images

Automatically Create, Test and Deploy EC2 AMIs

Creation, Maintenance, Validation, Sharing, and Deployment

For Linux or Windows images for use on AWS and on-premises

-------------------------------------------------------

# EC2 Instance Store

TLDR: EBS on steroid

Better IO perf than EBS

Trade off: EPHEMERAL storage, lost if stopped 

USE CASES: cache, buffer, scratch data, temporary content

RISK: lost data if hardware fails

BACKUPS and REPLICATION: your responsibility

-------------------------------------------------------

# EBS vs Instance Store

EBS = not shared by instances + data persists even after instance termination

Instance Store =  not shared by instances + better IO perf + data lost if EC2 instance is stopped or terminated, or when the underlying disk drive fails

-------------------------------------------------------

# EFS = Elastic File System

EFS is a Managed NFS (Network File System) that can be mounted on 1000s of EC2s at a time.

Can be mounted on instances across multiple Availability Zones (AZ)

NOT encrypted by default

HIGH AVAILABILITY by default
 — across how many AZs ?

-------------------------------------------------------

# EFS vs EBS

EBS = not shared by instances + data persists even after instance termination

EFS = shared by many instances (shared files system) + data does NOT persist after instance termination

Both NOT encrypted by default

-------------------------------------------------------

# EFS IA = EFS Infrequent Access

DISCOUNT of 92% compared to EFS Standard

OPTIMIZED for files rarely accessed

LIFECYCLE POLICY is used to enable EFS IA <br />
i.e. move files to EFS IA if files not accessed for 60 days

BILLING: pay a fee each time you read from or write data stored

DOES NOT sacrifice the high availability, high durability, elasticity, and POSIX file system access.

USE CASES: access for audit requirements, perform historical analysis, or perform backup and recovery

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon FSx

THIRD PARTY high-performance file system on AWS

- Amazon FSx for Windows File Server
- Amazon FSx for Lustre

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon FSx for Lustre

Scalable file storage for HPC (High Performance Computing)

Lustre = Linux + Cluster

USE CASES: Machine Learning, Video Processing, Financial Modeling...

SCALES up to 100s GB/s, millions of IOPS, sub-ms latencies

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon FSx for Windows File Server

For business applications

Fully managed, highly reliable, and scalable file storage

Accessible over the industry-standard Service Message Block (SMB) protocol. 

Built on Windows Server

Wide range of administrative features such as user quotas, end-user file restore, and Microsoft Active Directory (AD) integration.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Scalability and High Availability

Scalability = application/system ability to adapt to handle greater loads

Vertical Scalability = increase in instance size = SCALE UP / DOWN

Horizontal Scalability = Elasticity = increase in instance number = SCALE IN / OUT

-------------------------------------------------------

# High Availability

Goes hand-in-hand with Horizontal Scalability (Elasticity)

Applications run at least in two AZs to survive a data center loss. <br />
Multi-AZ deployment is an example of High Availability.

Supporting High Availability by default:
 - DynamoDB
 - EFS
 
-------------------------------------------------------

# ELB = Elastic Load Balancer

Managed Load Balancer, AWS:
- garantees it will be working
- takes care of upgrades, maintenance, high availability, fault tolerance
- provides config knobs

You could setup your own to save on total cost but it will be more work (so cost time and resources)

Types of Load Balancer:
1. APL = Application Load Balancer
2. NLB = Network Load Balancer
3. GWLB = Gateway Load Balancer

-------------------------------------------------------

# APL = Application Load Balancer

a. HTTP/HTTPS/gRPC protocols (Layer 7) <br />
b. Feature: HTTP Routing <br />
c. Use Case: Static DNS (URL)

-------------------------------------------------------

# NLB = Network Load Balancer

a. TCP/UDP Protocols (Layer 4) <br />
b. Feature: High Performance: millions of requests per second <br />
c. Use Case: Static IP through Elastic IP

-------------------------------------------------------

# GWLB = Gateway Load Balancer

a. GENEVE Protocol (Layer 3) <br />
b. Feature: Route Traffic to Firewalls that you manage on EC2 Instances <br />
c. Use Case: Intrusion detection

-------------------------------------------------------

# ASG = Auto Scaling Group

COMPUTE is scaled 

SAVINGS: only run the at optimal capacity

Goals:
- Spread load across instances
- Replace unhealthy instances / Handles failures of instances
- Scale out (add nodes) to match an increased load
- Scale in (remove nodes) to match a decreased load
- Make sure we have a min and max number of machines running
- Automatically register new instances to a load balancer

-------------------------------------------------------

# Auto Scaling Strategies

- Manual Scaling
- Predictive Scaling
- Dynamic Scaling : Simple/Step Scaling, Target Tracking Scaling, Scheduled Scaling

Auto Scaling in EC2 and DynamoDB are examples of horizontal scaling.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon S3

Stores data in a flat non-hierarchical structure.
No concept of directories and subdirectories.

key value based object storage service

Keys are the full path.
Keys are just very long names that contain slashes ("/")

Max Object Size: 5 TB

If uploading more than 5 GB, must use multi-part upload

Encrypted by default

Cost-Optimization
 - Offers Lifecycle configuration for cost-optimal storage
 - Does NOT support reservation to optimize costs.

https://aws.amazon.com/s3/

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon S3 - Security

User Based: IAM Policies, which API calls are allowed for specific IAM user

Resource Based:
- Bucket Policies — wide rules from the S3 console — allows cross account
- Object Access Control List (ACL) — finer grained
- Bucket Access Control List (ACL) — even finer grain?

Buckets???

-------------------------------------------------------

# S3 Block Public Access

By default, new buckets, access points, and objects don't allow public access.

However, users can modify bucket policies, access point policies, or object permissions to allow public access.

S3 Block Public Access settings override these policies and permissions so that you can limit public access to these resources.

-------------------------------------------------------

# static website on Amazon S3

Configure an Amazon S3 bucket for website hosting and then upload your website content to the bucket. 

You must enable website hosting, set permissions, and create and add an index document.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon S3 Versioning

Means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket.

Preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in your Amazon S3 bucket. 

-------------------------------------------------------

[...]

-------------------------------------------------------
-------------------------------------------------------

# Amazon RDS = Relational Database Service

SQL MANAGED service

AVAILABILITY: RDS Multi-AZ deployments’ main purpose (better failovers / disaster recovery) is high availability.

SCALABILITY: RDS Read replicas’ main purpose (better perf) is scalability — can also be used for failovers / disaster recovery.

You can use both read replicas and multi-AZ deployment for failovers / disaster recovery.

Multi-Region deployments’ main purpose is disaster recovery and local performance.

# VPC = Virtual Private Cloud

Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to launch AWS resources into a virtual network that you've defined.

Key Concepts for VPCs:

 - Virtual private cloud (VPC) — A virtual network dedicated to your AWS account.

 - Subnet — A range of IP addresses in your VPC.

 - Route table — A set of rules, called routes, that are used to determine where network traffic is directed.

 - Internet Gateway — A gateway that you attach to your VPC to enable communication between resources in your VPC and the internet.

 - VPC endpoint — Enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection.

VPC Use Case: a logically isolated section of AWS, where to launch AWS resources

VPC : Spans all of the Availability Zones (AZ) in the Region

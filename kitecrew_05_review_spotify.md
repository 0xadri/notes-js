## Meeting Purpose

Review Spotify's UX for inspiration on a new app's design.

## Key Takeaways

  - **Visual-First UI:** Spotify's UI is highly visual, using images and icons to represent content. Text is reserved for unique identifiers (e.g., song titles), making the interface feel clean and intuitive.
  - **Flexible 3-Column Layout:** The core layout is a 3-column content area flanked by sticky header/footer bars. The left ("Your Library") and right ("Now Playing") panels are expandable, allowing users to focus on specific tasks or view content in a full-screen mode.
  - **Universal Tagging:** Content is categorized using a single, universal tagging system (e.g., "Playlist," "Artist"). This abstracts away backend distinctions, simplifying the user experience and making content discovery more intuitive.
  - **Web App Feel:** The interface feels like a desktop application, not a website. This is reinforced by the persistent header/footer and a non-fully-responsive design (optimized for desktop/tablet, not mobile).

## Topics

### Overall Structure & Layout

  - **Web App Feel:** The UI is designed as a desktop-style web app, not a website.
      - **Reinforced by:** Persistent header/footer bars and a non-fully-responsive layout (optimized for desktop/tablet, not mobile).
  - **Core Layout:** A 3-column content area is flanked by sticky header and footer bars.
      - **Header:** Navigation, search, user profile.
      - **Footer:** Global playback controls.
      - **Content Area:**
          - **Left Panel:** "Your Library"
          - **Center Panel:** Main content feed
          - **Right Panel:** "Now Playing"

### Left Panel: "Your Library"

  - **Function:** Manages saved content (playlists, artists, etc.).
  - **Filtering:** Uses a universal tagging system (e.g., "Playlist," "Artist," "Album," "Podcast") to simplify content organization for users.
  - **Expandability:** Can be expanded to replace the center panel, providing a focused view of the user's library.
      - **Collapse States:** Can be narrowed to an icon-only bar or fully hidden.

### Center Panel: Main Content Feed

  - **Function:** Displays personalized content feeds.
  - **Content Sections:** Organized vertically with infinite scroll.
      - **Hero Section:** Recently played items.
      - **New Releases:** Featured music.
      - **Featured Playlists:** Curated content (e.g., "It's Music Friday").
      - **Audiobooks:** A separate content category.

### Right Panel: "Now Playing"

  - **Function:** Displays details for the currently playing item.
  - **Expandability:** Can be expanded to replace the center panel, creating a full-screen player view.
      - **Inspiration:** The black/green color scheme and full-screen player evoke classic MP3 players like Winamp.

### Key Design Principles

  - **Visual-First UI:** Prioritizes images and icons over text.
      - **Icons:** Used for all actions and meta-information.
      - **Text:** Reserved for unique content identifiers (e.g., song titles, artist names) to ensure clarity.
  - **Universal Tagging:** A single tag system simplifies content categorization.
      - **Benefit:** Abstracts away backend distinctions (e.g., "playlist" vs. "album"), making the interface more intuitive for users.

## Next Steps

  - **Adrien:**
      - Adopt a visual-first UI, prioritizing images and icons over text.
      - Use text only for unique content identifiers.
      - Implement a universal tagging system for all content types.
      - Explore a flexible 3-column layout with expandable side panels.

## Action Items

- **Add tag system (music, podcasts, audiobooks, albums, artists, playlists, tracks) to app**

## Annotations


**HIGHLIGHT**
- **Tags** - Adrien emphasizes tags' importance and suggests introducing them from the beginning

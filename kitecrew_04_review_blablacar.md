## Meeting Purpose

Review Blablacar.com for features to replicate in a new web app.

## Key Takeaways

  - **Core Flow:** A landing page search (start/end city, date) leads to a dedicated results page with a persistent, condensed search bar.
  - **Results Page:** A left-hand filter panel is essential for refining results by sort order (e.g., price, time) and specific criteria (e.g., instant booking, pet-friendly).
  - **Navigation:** A simple top nav with a clear "Publish a Ride" call-to-action (CTA) is sufficient.

## Topics

### Landing Page & Navigation

  - **Navigation Bar:** A slim top bar with a prominent "Publish a Ride" CTA.
  - **Search Box:** The central feature for users to input a ride's start city, destination city, and date.

### Search Results Page

  - **Layout:** A dedicated page with a persistent, condensed search bar at the top, mirroring the landing page's functionality.
  - **Left-Hand Filter Panel:** A critical component for refining results.
      - **Sort Options:**
          - Earliest departure
          - Lowest price
          - Distance to departure point
          - Distance to arrival point
          - Shortest ride
      - **Filter Criteria:**
          - **Time:** Pickup time
          - **Trust & Safety:** Profile verification status
          - **Amenities:**
              - Number of people in the back
              - Instant booking availability
              - Smoking allowed
              - Pets allowed
  - **Main Results Panel:** Displays a list of ride cards for the selected day.
      - A "Load More Results" button loads additional rides (for the current day).

## Next Steps

  - **Adrien:**
      - Replicate the Blablacar.com search flow: landing page search → dedicated results page.
      - Implement a left-hand filter panel with sort and filter options.
      - Design a slim top navigation bar with a "Publish a Ride" CTA.

## Meeting Purpose

Analyze the Airbnb interface for potential use in another project.

## Key Takeaways

  - **Homepage Strategy:** A large, multi-tab footer with 60+ destination links is the primary tool for inspiring travel and driving user engagement.
  - **Search Results Page (SRP):** A split-panel layout (map on right, results on left) with highly detailed cards that include a star rating *and* the total review count, providing critical social proof.
  - **Cancellation Policies:** The SRP's explicit display of cancellation terms is a key feature that must be included in any project using this model.

## Topics

### Homepage

      - **Top Bar:** Logo (left) → Booking types (Homes, Experiences) → Secondary actions (Become a Host, Language).
      - **Search Box:** Destination, Check-in/out dates, Guests (adults, children).
  - **Content Grid:**
      - \~10 rows of "Popular" or "Featured" destinations (e.g., Madrid, Paris).
      - **Critique:** Potentially overwhelming due to the high volume of rows.
  - **Massive Footer:**
      - **Inspiration Section:**
          - Multi-tab layout (Popular, Beach, Cities, etc.).
          - Each tab: 6 columns × 3 items (city name).

      - **Title:** Host-defined name for the property.
      - **Rating:** Star rating *and* the total number of reviews (e.g., 4.8 (123)).
          - **Significance:** The review count provides social proof, showing the rating's reliability.
      - **Description:**
          - Shortened summary.
          - Bedroom/bed count (e.g., "2 bedrooms, 2 double beds").

      - **Cancellation:** Explicitly stated policy (e.g., "Free cancellation").

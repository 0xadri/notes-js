## How To Learn

**Always**
- Journal progress
- Take notes, try to summarise
- Brainstorm questions (ton of them) - try to answer them later
- Think in analogy, and try to find mental models

**Similar To When Learning To Juggle**
1. decompose, break down skills in tiny separate parts you can practice in isolation - "isolated games" - i.e. tiny leetcodes, tiny tutorial
2. once getting better, try put it in a more usual context â€” "small games" - i.e. larger leetcode, larger tutorial, or small play-project
3. once move near perfect, try put it in a sequence - "medium games" - i.e. project

**Bainstorm Questions**
- problem statement (the why), differences (X vs Y), trade offs (balancing act), pair (this alway/often goes with that), basic syntax, corner cases, shocking/weird facts and cases, history

**Coding: Think of it like "it's just a game"**
- You learn the rules of the game to be able to build stuff.
- Just like any game, you can try to learn part or all the rules before playing. But learning the rules while playing is probably best.

**LeetCode: Think of it like "going to the gym"**
- Going to the gym may not make you the best player, but it will increase your condition and raw power

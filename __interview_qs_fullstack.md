# What does ESM stand for?

ESM = ECMAScript Modules = ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) Modules

Since ECMAScript 2015 (ES6), javascript supports built-in modules through the new syntax.

JavaScript did not have built-in support for modules prior to 2015. We had to use other module systems, i.e. AMD and CommonJS

-------------------------------------------------------

# How do you optimize the server side?

1. HTTP Caching: reduce sent files - allows users to store assets like images, JavaScript files, and CSS files on their computer.

2. HTTP Compression: reduce size of sent files - send compressed assets (images, fonts, JS and CSS files) that are significantly smaller, typically around 75% smaller.

3. CDN: reduce latency - CDNs distribute static assets globally, reducing latency by serving content from locations closer to the user.

4. (optional) DNS Preconnect - less used but possible - technique to speed up connections by resolving domain names before a user requests them.

-------------------------------------------------------

# What are the headers for caching?

Both `ETag` and `Last-Modified` headers are used for caching and validation.

However:

 - `ETag` relies on unique identifier generated - robust and accurate mechanism for determining if a resource has changed.

 - `Last-Modified` relies on timestamps - less precise due to factors like server clock synchronization and potential for multiple changes within the same second.

TLDR: `ETag` is preferred for most scenarios.

Best Practice: use both, for maximum caching efficiency and to handle cases where one header might be more appropriate than the other

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/824152/what-takes-precedence-the-etag-or-last-modified-http-header

-------------------------------------------------------

# How does ETag work?

A unique identifier generated by the server for each version of a resource. This can be a hash of the resource's content or other identifying information. 

Clients send the `ETag` in the `If-None-Match` header during subsequent requests. The server compares this with its current `ETag` and returns a `304 Not Modified` if they match. 

Pros: does not dependent on timestamps.

Cons: Can be more resource-intensive to generate and compare, especially for complex resources.

Cons: Some proxies and CDNs may not handle ETag correctly.

Best Practice: great with resources that change frequently or when high accuracy is needed.

# What are the best practices when measuring performances in chrome?

1. Always in incognito window

2. Triple check throttling - under the Network tab, select "No Throttling"

3. Clear cache - under the Network tab, you can right-click on bundled file then click "Clear Cache"

4. Disable cache on first performance test - under the Network tab, tick "Disable Cache"

   a. Check loaded file is with `Status Code 200` (ok) - under the Network tab, click on bundle file, click on "Headers", see under "Status Code"
   
   b. Check loaded file timing - under the Network tab, click on bundle file, click on "Timing", see under "Content Download"
   
5. Enable cache on following performance tests - under the Network tab, tick "Disable Cache"

   a. Check loaded file is with `Status Code 304` (not modified) - under the Network tab, click on bundle file, click on "Headers", see under "Status Code"

   b. Check loaded file timing (should be much longer) - under the Network tab, click on bundle file, click on "Timing", see under "Content Download"

# What are the best practices when using Lighthouse in chrome?

Always in incognito

-------------------------------------------------------

# How does Last-Modified work?

Indicates the last time a resource was modified on the server, typically using a timestamp. 

Clients send the timestamp in the `If-Modified-Since` header during subsequent requests. The server compares this with its own timestamp and returns a `304 Not Modified` if the resource hasn't changed. 

Pros: Widely supported, easier to implement than ETag.

Cons: Timestamp-based, can have accuracy issues.

Cons: Not suitable for resources that change multiple times within a second. 

Best Practice: if the resource changes infrequently and one-second granularity is sufficient.

-------------------------------------------------------

# How do you optimize the Static Assets?

Optimizing CSS, Images and Fonts.

1. CSS: Extract & Minify: Extract CSS from JavaScript and minify it for more efficient load times.

2. CSS: Critical CSS: the CSS necessary for rendering above-the-fold content should be extracted and added as an inline style to the HTML document to eliminate render-blocking requests.

3. Image: Size Adjustments: Serve images as small as possible (dependent on design requirement) and apply image optimization algorithms.

4. Image: Format Adjustment: use `WebP` for best performance (we can use module bundlers like Webpack to transform images at build time).

5. Image: Responsive Sizing: Ensure image dimensions are optimized for their display size to reduce unnecessary loading (use `srcset` attribute).

6. Image: Lazy Loading: load images that are not in the viewport (above the fold) after the initial load. Also use `loading="lazy"` attribute to defer loading until the image is near the viewport.

7. Fonts: Host On Server: to eliminate requests to 3rd parties, also apply caching and compression to font assets. Use the `woff2` format for fonts for best performance.

# What is a preflight request in the context of HTTP?

A request to check the CORS status with the server.

Checks if the server supports the requested method and headers part of the CORS mechanism.

This is done by sending an OPTIONS request to the server with the Access-Control-Request-Method and Access-Control-Request-Headers headers.

-------------------------------------------------------

# When using the `Basic Auth` mechanism what does the `Authorization Header` contains?

# What are some advantages of using an ORM?

ORM (Object-relational mapper) allows us to 

1. write less code to query the database

2. leverage OOP principles(like encapsulation) when interacting with the database

-------------------------------------------------------

# What is the purpose of a database migration?

To keep track of the changes made to the database schema.

A database migration is used to syncronize code changes with the database schema by creating a new version of the database schema that matches the models(schema) from the codebase.

-------------------------------------------------------

-------------------------------------------------------

# Which of the following are disadvantages of indexing a database table? (2 options apply)

It has to be updated every-time the data changes(insert, update, delete)

It makes the database insert and update operations slower

It takes up extra space(as we need to store the data structure)

-------------------------------------------------------

# An API Service receives input field values from the frontend and use it them directly in database queries. Which web security attacks does this make it vulnerable to?

# A user is logged into their online banking account. While logged in, the user visits a malicious website(same browser window). This website contains a hidden form that automatically submits a request to transfer money from the user's bank account to the attacker's account. Since the user is already authenticated on the banking site, the request is processed without additional verification. What type of web security attack does this scenario describe?

Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

CSRF is an attack where a malicious website, email, or program causes a user's web browser to perform an unwanted action on a trusted site where the user is already authenticated.

Key Characteristics of CSRF:

 - Exploits authenticated sessions.

 - Tricks the user's browser into making an unwanted request.

 - The request is processed because it appears legitimate to the server.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Which of the following measures can help prevent a Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack?

Employing load balancers and traffic filtering

Implementing rate limiting

# In the context of TLS and HTTPS

Asymmetric encryption does NOT use the same key for encryption and decryption.

Asymmetric encryption is used during the TLS handshake to securely exchange a symmetric encryption key.

The symmetric key will be used for the rest of the connection to encrypt data (using symmetric encryption) as it is much more computationally cheaper than asymmetric encryption.

-------------------------------------------------------

# What is the relationship between an HTTPS certificate and the public and private keys in the context of establishing a secure connection?

The HTTPS certificate contains the server's public key, which is used by the client to encrypt the symmetric encryption key in the TLS handshake.

The public key in the HTTPS certificate is used by clients to securely send data to the server and establish a secure connection.

HTTPS secure connection steps:

 - When a client connects to a server over `HTTPS`, the server presents its `SSL/TLS` certificate to the client.

 - The client verifies the certificate's validity and the identity of the server.

 - The client then uses the `public key` in the certificate to encrypt a symmetric session key.

 - The server decrypts the `symmetric session key` with its private key.

 - This symmetric key is then used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged during the session, providing a secure communication channel.


-------------------------------------------------------

# In HTTPS, which type of encryption is actually used during the communication session after the initial connection is established?

Symmetric encryption.

After the initial TLS handshake, the symmetric encryption key is used to encrypt and decrypt data exchanged during the session. This is much more computationally cheaper than asymmetric encryption.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Scenario: A user visits a web forum like Reddit and views a post that contains a hidden script. The forum's backend does not properly sanitize user input, allowing the attacker to inject the script into the post content. When another user views this post, the script runs in the user's browser and sends the user's session cookie to the attacker's server. Later, the attacker uses this session cookie to impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to the user's account. Question: What type of web security attack does this scenario describe?

XSS

# Which deployment styles have zero downtime?

1. Blue/Green Deployment

2. Canary Deployment

Blue/Green Deployment - a new version of the application is deployed to a new environment and the old environment is replaced with the new one if the new version is successful.

Canary Deployment - a new version of the application is deployed to a small percentage of the users and the old version is still available to the rest of the users.

# What is the main advantage of using containers in CI/CD?

To standardise most of the release process - easier to deploy

-------------------------------------------------------

# What is Kubernetes ?

An open-source tool used to deploy and operate containers - it is a container orchestration tool.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Advantages of a micro-frontends architecture?

Development Speed: work in parallel, and deploy independently.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Which Architecture Style achieves the maximum decoupling between services?

Event-driven Architecture - almost no coupling between services.

Services consume and produce events that are published to an Event Mediator or Event Bus (SQS Queues, Kafka). 

We can "plug and play" services into the Event Bus or terminate one of them without affecting any other services.

# What devices qualify as a reverse proxy?

1. Load Balancers

2. CDNs

3. API Gateway

-------------------------------------------------------

# A TTL (time to live) value of zero in a cache means that ...

The cache will expire immediately: `no-cache` policy.

The TTL (time to live) is the time the asset will be considered FRESH in the cache. 

A TTL of zero means the asset is immediately considered STALE which is the equivalent of having no cache.

-------------------------------------------------------

# We know our service will be scaled horizontally across a couple of instances. When designing it, we should?

 - Avoid state in the instances (use REST instead)

 - Avoid local caching and use a shared cache (i.e. Redis)

-------------------------------------------------------

# A load balancer implementing a Round-Robin algorithm will forward requests to ...

The next instance in a sequential/circular order.

Round-Robin is a rather naive algo.

-------------------------------------------------------

# What is ESLint?

ESLint is a configurable JavaScript linter. It helps you find and fix problems in your JavaScript code. 

Problems can be anything from potential runtime bugs, to not following best practices, to styling issues.

# Docker Orchestrators run many containers on a single machine. Is that correct?

Not quite — that’s a common misconception.

Docker orchestrators (like Kubernetes or Docker Swarm) are designed to run and manage containers across multiple machines — not just a single one.

Think of it this way:

 - Docker Engine runs containers on a single machine.

 - A Docker Orchestrator manages a cluster of machines (called nodes) and spreads containers across them intelligently.

Orchestrators CAN run multiple containers on a single machine, if:

 - You're running a single-node cluster (for development/testing).

 - That’s where the resources allow containers to run.

But the true power of orchestration comes from managing many machines (nodes) and distributing containers across them.

-------------------------------------------------------

# Isn't it very heavy to include a Linux in every single Container, even if a light version of Linux ?

Nope. See the size of Alpine Linux and distroless images:

| Image type   | Approx. size | Notes                                                  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `ubuntu`     | \~29 MB      | Full-featured OS                                       |
| `alpine`     | \~5 MB       | Ultra-minimal Linux                                    |
| `distroless` | < 2 MB       | No package manager or shell; only app and dependencies |

Comparison to VMs:

| --------- | --------------- | ------------------ |
| Kernel    | Included        | Shared with host   |
| Boot time | Minutes         | Seconds            |

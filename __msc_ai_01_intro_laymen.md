# Why AI For SWE

AI is to devs what Electric Bicycles are to cyclists: it helps everyone from total beginners to elite devs.

AI however, is like riding a wild horse: you must learn to tame it, to control its insane power otherwise it'll create garbage.

Great gains in both quality and quantity/productivity.

Impacts your entire software product development lifecycle

# AI IDEs and CLIs

Most Popular:
- *Claude Code* by Anthropic (CLI)
- *Claude Code in VS Studio* by Anthropic (IDE)
- *Cursor* (IDE)

*Claude Code* by Anthropic is definitely the leader in the space. Every competitor copies them and/or follow the open standards they establish.  
 
Underdogs:
- *Codex* by OpenAI (IDE)
- *Antigravity* by Google (IDE)
- *Github Copilot* by MS (IDE)

Antigravity and Codex are more recent ones, less established and potentially more buggy.

Github Copilot is not recent but lags in terms of UX and features.

When copy/pasting info to an online LLM:
- Remove your full name from the path in the shell

# Which statements about garbage collection and memory leaks are true?

1. Garbage collection automatically frees all unused memory.
2. Memory leaks can still occur even in garbage-collected languages.
3. Circular references can prevent garbage collectors from reclaiming memory.
4. Garbage collectors operate in real-time, immediately reclaiming memory when it's no longer referenced.

# Which type of memory is generally preferred for storing temporary data in a program, such as local variables within a function?

Stack

# Garbage collection and memory leaks

Memory leaks can still occur even in garbage-collected languages.

Circular references can prevent garbage collectors from reclaiming memory.

Garbage collection does NOT:
 - automatically free memory
 - operate in real-time by immediately reclaiming memory when no longer referenced

# In the memory hierarchy, which type of memory typically has the fastest access time?

Fastest to slowest:

a. SSD

b. CPU Cache (L1, L2, L3)

c. HDD

d. RAM

Solution:

1. CPU Cache (L1, L2, L3) - the fastest and most expensive memory type.

2. RAM

3. SSD

4. HDD

# Steps a CPU follows to interpret code in a CPU Cycle?

- Fetch
- Decode
- Execute
